C has few abstractions. It's a blank page language: you can write code in any shape and form. Yet this creates many problems. The worst problem is that every developer does it their own way. Every project is unique. Often, even inside a project there is little or no consistency.
The economics work against creating new projects. It is cheaper and easier to extend existing ones, as you can use the work already done. This is a Bad Thing. Creating new projects must cost nothing. This frees us to experiment, reshape, copy, and learn.

One reason git beat old Subversion hands down is that it erased the cost of creating a code repository. In the Old Times, creating a repository and setting it up for remote access was days of work. In my firm we could only afford one repository (we were poor if not humble). All projects sat inside that.
To fix blank page syndrome, we look at C projects and we realize, they could all look much the same. Sure, they all look different today. Yet that's just historical accident. With a little care and design we can model them all around the same template. Then, to create a new project, we just grab an empty template.
I'll assume you are making public software, and you accepted my recommendation to use the MPLv2. We now come to the question of ownership. The copyright to any non-trivial work (thus, ownership of code) lies with its author, a person or business. By default, no-one can use or distribute the work without the owner's OK.
A license grants others the rights to use, remix, and distribute the work under certain conditions. It is like putting up a sign saying, "You may walk on my lawn if you don't damage it."+

Asking contributors to give copyrights to a project is clumsy and ponderous. It is simpler that they license their contributions under the project license. This creates a collective work owned by many people, under a single license. If you use the MPLv2 and the GitHub fork and merge model, then patches are by default also licensed under MPLv2.
Thus, you can merge them without asking the contributor for a license grant, and without risk.
You do need to watch out for "unsafe" patches. This means, ones that change the project LICENSE or the blurb in any source, or which add sources with new blurbs.
