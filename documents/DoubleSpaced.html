Since 1951, MLA has been publishing guidelines for style, including instructions on documenting the use of sources. While the methods have changed over the years (from notes and bibliography to parenthetical citations and works cited), what follows are models based on the 6th edition of the </span><span class="c0 c2">MLA Handbook for Writers of Research Papers</span><span class="c0">(2003). The MLA Style web site (</span><span class="c0 c4"><a class="c3" href="http://www.mla.org/style_faq">http://www.mla.org/style_faq</a></span><span class="c0">) will inform its users of documentation format changes or additions as they occur.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In this </span><span class="c0 c2">MCC Guide to Writing Research Papers,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;we give examples for the types of resources used by students most often. In the MLA Style of Documentation, in-text citations and list of Works Cited/Consulted are the forms of documentation. They are modeled in the Sample Paper.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Note how in Works Cited sources are alphabetized, indented, and spaced.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c6">Citing Books and Other Non-Periodical Publications</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The order of information in an MLA listing is fixed. The author(s) last name comes first. It is separated by a comma from the first name, which is followed by a period. The title comes next, and it is underlined. * The title is followed by the place of publication and punctuated with a colon. The publisher&#39;s name is listed next, followed by a comma. The year of publication follows and is punctuated with a period. See the following example of a book listing:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Smith, Alison. Name All the Animals. New York: Scribner, 2005.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">*In research papers and manuscripts submitted for publication, titles of sources are best underlined rather than italicized. Italic type is sometimes not distinctive enough. To avoid ambiguity, underline rather than italicize&mdash;or check with your instructor. When preparing a manuscript for publication, consult with your editor how to represent italicization. </span></p></body></html>
